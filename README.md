# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## Project Overview
The intent of this software system is to assist in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a frequent complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina and may result in blindness or vision loss. The system analyses retinal image data and categorizes it as having or not having diabetic retinopathy using machine learning methods like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to create an effective and precise method for the early identification of diabetic retinopathy, leveraging the strengths of various machine learning algorithms to increase accuracy and efficiency. The outcomes aim to create an affordable, scalable system for early diagnosis, potentially saving people's vision globally.
